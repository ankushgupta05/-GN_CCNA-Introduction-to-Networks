| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | What IPv4 header field identifies the upper layer protocol carried in the packet?                     | âœ… **Protocol**                                                                                               | The `Protocol` field in the IPv4 header indicates the next-level protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).            |
| 2  | What information does the loopback test provide?                                                      | âœ… **The TCP/IP stack on the device is working correctly.**                                                   | Loopback test (`ping 127.0.0.1`) verifies if the TCP/IP stack is functioning on the device.            |
| 3  | Which statement describes a feature of the IP protocol?                                               | âœ… **IP relies on upper layer services to handle situations of missing or out-of-order packets.**             | IP is a connectionless protocol and doesn't ensure reliability; thatâ€™s handled by TCP.                 |
| 4  | What is one advantage that the IPv6 simplified header offers over IPv4?                               | âœ… **efficient packet handling**                                                                              | IPv6 has a simplified header to improve processing efficiency in routers.                              |
| 5  | Which field in the IPv4 header is used to prevent a packet from traversing a network endlessly?       | âœ… **Time-to-Live**                                                                                           | TTL limits the lifetime of a packet to prevent infinite loops.                                         |
| 6  | What are two services provided by the OSI network layer?                                              | âœ… **encapsulating PDUs from the transport layer**<br>âœ… **routing packets toward the destination**            | Network layer encapsulates and routes packets to their destinations.                                   |
| 7  | What is the purpose of configuring a switch with a default gateway address?                           | âœ… **The default gateway address is used to forward packets originating from the switch to remote networks.** | It's used when the switch (e.g., for remote management) needs to reach outside networks.               |
| 8  | Which parameter does the router use to choose the path to the destination when multiple routes exist? | âœ… **the lower metric value that is associated with the destination network**                                 | Routers prefer paths with the **lowest metric** (e.g., cost, hop count).                               |
| 9  | A computer can access devices on the same network but not others. Whatâ€™s the probable cause?          | âœ… **The computer has an invalid default gateway address.**                                                   | Without a correct default gateway, packets to other networks cannot be routed.                         |
| 10 | What is the aim of an ARP spoofing attack?                                                            | âœ… **to associate IP addresses to the wrong MAC address**                                                     | ARP spoofing tricks devices into associating the wrong MAC with an IP address.                         |
| 11 | PC1 sends an ARP request to connect to File\_server1. Which MAC will it receive?                      | âœ… **the MAC address of the G0/0 interface on R1**                                                            | Since File\_server1 is on a remote network, PC1 sends the packet to R1, so ARP resolves R1's G0/0 MAC. |
| 12 | How are ARP requests treated on the local link?                                                       | âœ… **They are received and processed by every device on the local network.**                                  | ARP requests are broadcast to all devices on the local subnet.                                         |
| 13 | What does `arp -d *` do on a PC?                                                                      | âœ… **The ARP cache is cleared.**                                                                              | This command removes all dynamic entries from the ARP table.                                           |
| 14 | What does a Layer 2 device examine in the Ethernet frame header?                                      | âœ… **destination MAC address**                                                                                | Switches use the **destination MAC** to forward frames at Layer 2.                                     |
| 15 | Where are IPv4-to-L2 Ethernet mappings maintained on a host?                                          | âœ… **ARP cache**                                                                                              | The ARP cache stores IP-to-MAC mappings on the device.                                                 |
