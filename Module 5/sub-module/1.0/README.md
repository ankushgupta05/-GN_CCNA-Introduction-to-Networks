### ✅ **5.0.1 Why should I take this module?**

Welcome to **Number Systems**!

As a network administrator, understanding number systems is critical. For example:

* A binary IPv4 address: `11000000.10101000.00001010.00001010`
* In dotted decimal: `192.168.10.10`

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and use **hexadecimal** (0-9, A-F) to simplify them.

💡 **Why it matters:**

* You must convert:

  * Binary ↔ Dotted Decimal
  * Dotted Decimal ↔ Hexadecimal
  * (Binary is the bridge between decimal and hexadecimal.)

### 🎯 **5.0.2 What will I learn to do in this module?**

**Module Title:** Number Systems
**Module Objective:**
✔ **Convert numbers between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal systems.**

Here’s a **simple explanation** of section **5.1.1 Binary and IPv4 Addresses** with an **easy example** to help you understand:

---

### 📘 **5.1.1 Binary and IPv4 Addresses – Simplified**

* **Binary System (Base-2):** Uses only `0` and `1`.
* **Decimal System (Base-10):** Uses digits `0` to `9`.

#### 🧠 Why it matters:

* Computers and network devices (routers, PCs, switches) **communicate using binary IPv4 addresses**.
* But humans prefer working with **decimal** numbers.
* That’s why we convert **binary ↔ decimal** to make things manageable.

### 🖥️ **Example – Understanding Binary to Decimal Conversion**

Let’s take this **binary IPv4 address**:

```
11000000.10101000.00001010.00001010
```

Split into 4 **octets** (each 8 bits):

| Octet | Binary   | Decimal Conversion     |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | 11000000 | 128 + 64 = **192**     |
| 2     | 10101000 | 128 + 32 + 8 = **168** |
| 3     | 00001010 | 8 + 2 = **10**         |
| 4     | 00001010 | 8 + 2 = **10**         |

So the **dotted decimal** version is:

```
192.168.10.10
```

✅ This is much easier for humans to read and remember!

### 📌 Network Example

| Device    | Binary Address                      | Dotted Decimal Address |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| PC1       | 11000000.10101000.00001010.00001010 | 192.168.10.10          |
| PC2       | 11000000.10101000.00001011.00001010 | 192.168.11.10          |
| R1 G0/0/0 | 11000000.10101000.00001010.00000001 | 192.168.10.1           |
| R1 G0/0/1 | 11000000.10101000.00001011.00000001 | 192.168.11.1           |
| WAN       | 11010001.10100101.11001000.11100001 | 209.165.200.225        |

Each IP address is 32 bits (4 octets), and each octet is 8 bits = 1 byte.

### 🎯 Why You Should Practice This

* You'll often see addresses like `192.168.10.0/24` in real networks.
* To configure or troubleshoot, you must be able to **understand both binary and decimal** forms.
