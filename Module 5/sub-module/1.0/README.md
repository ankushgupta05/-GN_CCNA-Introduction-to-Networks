### âœ… **5.0.1 Why should I take this module?**

Welcome to **Number Systems**!

As a network administrator, understanding number systems is critical. For example:

* A binary IPv4 address: `11000000.10101000.00001010.00001010`
* In dotted decimal: `192.168.10.10`

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and use **hexadecimal** (0-9, A-F) to simplify them.

ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:**

* You must convert:

  * Binary â†” Dotted Decimal
  * Dotted Decimal â†” Hexadecimal
  * (Binary is the bridge between decimal and hexadecimal.)

ðŸ•¹ **Helpful Tool:** Play the **Binary Game** in the module to build your skills!
