# HexaDecimal ko convert karo decimal mai :
Ans :-
1st convert into Binary and then resulted binary digit will be convert into decimal

Here’s the key explanation for the **“a”** and **“b”** you asked about in the context of this topic:

---

### In Hexadecimal:

* **`a` (or `A`) in hexadecimal = 10 in decimal**
* **`b` (or `B`) in hexadecimal = 11 in decimal**

These values are part of the base-16 number system, which uses digits `0-9` and letters `A-F` to represent values from `0 to 15`.

| Decimal | Binary | Hexadecimal |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 10      | 1010   | A           |
| 11      | 1011   | B           |

---

### Why it's important:

* In **IPv6 addressing**, each 4-bit binary group is represented by **1 hexadecimal digit**.
* So, a binary group like `1010` becomes `A`, and `1011` becomes `B`.
* For example, in the IPv6 address `2001:db8::1`, the `db8` part includes `d = 13`, `b = 11`, and `8 = 8` in decimal.

Here are the correct answers and explanations for each question on hexadecimal number system:

| Q# | Question                                                | Correct Answer | Explanation                                                       |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Which is the hexadecimal equivalent of 202?             | **CA**         | 202 in decimal → CA in hex (202 ÷ 16 = 12 R 10 → C (12), A (10)). |
| 2  | Which is the hexadecimal equivalent of 254?             | **FE**         | 254 ÷ 16 = 15 R 14 → F (15), E (14). So 254 = **FE** in hex.      |
| 3  | Which is the decimal equivalent of A9?                  | **169**        | A = 10, so A9 = 10×16 + 9 = 160 + 9 = **169**.                    |
| 4  | Which of the following is the decimal equivalent of 7D? | **125**        | 7D = 7×16 + 13 = 112 + 13 = **125**.                              |
