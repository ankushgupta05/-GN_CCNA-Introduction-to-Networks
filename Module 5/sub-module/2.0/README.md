# HexaDecimal ko convert karo decimal mai :
Ans :-
1st convert into Binary and then resulted binary digit will be convert into decimal

Here’s the key explanation for the **“a”** and **“b”** you asked about in the context of this topic:

### In Hexadecimal:

* **`a` (or `A`) in hexadecimal = 10 in decimal**
* **`b` (or `B`) in hexadecimal = 11 in decimal**

These values are part of the base-16 number system, which uses digits `0-9` and letters `A-F` to represent values from `0 to 15`.

| Decimal | Binary | Hexadecimal |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 10      | 1010   | A           |
| 11      | 1011   | B           |

### Why it's important:

* In **IPv6 addressing**, each 4-bit binary group is represented by **1 hexadecimal digit**.
* So, a binary group like `1010` becomes `A`, and `1011` becomes `B`.
* For example, in the IPv6 address `2001:db8::1`, the `db8` part includes `d = 13`, `b = 11`, and `8 = 8` in decimal.

Would you like a simple example of converting an IPv6 address segment to binary or decimal?
