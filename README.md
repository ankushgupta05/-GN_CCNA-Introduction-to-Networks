| 🅐 Encapsulation | ✅ Correct   | This is the process of wrapping data with protocol headers at each layer. |
| 🅑 Flow control  | ❌ Incorrect | Flow control manages the rate of data transmission.                       |
| 🅒 Segmentation  | ❌ Incorrect | Segmentation splits data into smaller chunks.                             |

### **Question 21**

**A web client is receiving a response for a web page from a web server. From the perspective of the client, what is the correct order of the protocol stack that is used to decode the received transmission?**

| Option                     | Answer      | Explanation                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🅐 HTTP, Ethernet, IP, TCP | ❌ Incorrect | Ethernet comes first at the bottom, not the top.                |
| 🅑 Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP | ✅ Correct   | This is the correct order for de-encapsulation (bottom to top). |
| 🅒 HTTP, TCP, IP, Ethernet | ❌ Incorrect | This is the order for encapsulation, not de-encapsulation.      |
| 🅓 Ethernet, TCP, IP, HTTP | ❌ Incorrect | The correct middle order is IP before TCP.                      |

### **Question 22**

**What layer is responsible for routing messages through an internetwork in the TCP/IP model?**

| Option            | Answer      | Explanation                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🅐 Transport      | ❌ Incorrect | Transport ensures delivery, not routing.            |
| 🅑 Session        | ❌ Incorrect | Session is part of the OSI model, not TCP/IP.       |
| 🅒 Internet       | ✅ Correct   | The Internet layer is responsible for routing (IP). |
| 🅓 Network access | ❌ Incorrect | This layer handles the physical transmission.       |

### **Question 23**

**Which two OSI model layers have the same functionality as a single layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose two.)**

| Option      | Answer      | Explanation                                             |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Physical  | ✅ Correct   | Combined into the Network Access layer in TCP/IP.       |
| ✅ Data link | ✅ Correct   | Combined into the Network Access layer in TCP/IP.       |
| ⛔ Transport | ❌ Incorrect | Maps 1:1 with TCP/IP transport layer.                   |
| ⛔ Network   | ❌ Incorrect | Also maps directly to TCP/IP Internet layer.            |
| ⛔ Session   | ❌ Incorrect | Session is merged into the Application layer in TCP/IP. |

### **Question 24**

**Which statement is correct about network protocols?**

| Option                                                    | Answer      | Explanation                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🅐 Only needed for remote networks                        | ❌ Incorrect | Protocols are used for both local and remote communication. |
| 🅑 Define message exchange between source and destination | ✅ Correct   | Protocols provide rules for communication.                  |
| 🅒 All function in network access layer                   | ❌ Incorrect | Protocols work across all layers, not just one.             |
| 🅓 Define hardware and rack mounting                      | ❌ Incorrect | That’s related to physical standards, not protocols.        |

### **Question 25**

**What is an advantage of network devices using open standard protocols?**

| Option                                             | Answer      | Explanation                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🅐 Different OS systems can exchange data          | ✅ Correct   | Open standards ensure interoperability.                    |
| 🅑 Competition and innovation are limited          | ❌ Incorrect | Open standards encourage competition and innovation.       |
| 🅒 Communication is limited to same-vendor devices | ❌ Incorrect | This applies to proprietary protocols, not open standards. |
| 🅓 Internet is controlled by a single ISP          | ❌ Incorrect | This is unrelated to the concept of open protocols.        |
