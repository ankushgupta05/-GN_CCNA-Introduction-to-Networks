# Final Exam

Here are **questions 1 to 12** with answers and explanations:

---

### Question 1

**Which two devices would be described as intermediary devices? (Choose two.)**

* ⬜ server
* ⬜ assembly line robots
* ✅ wireless LAN controller
* ⬜ retail scanner
* ⬜ gaming console
* ✅ IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

**Explanation:**
Intermediary devices help in managing, controlling, or directing traffic in a network (e.g., routers, switches, wireless controllers, firewalls, IPS). Servers, scanners, gaming consoles are end devices.

---

### Question 2

**Which statement describes network security?**

⬜ It ensures sensitive corporate data is available for authorized users.
✅ It supports growth over time in accordance with approved network design procedures.
⬜ It prioritizes data flows in order to give priority to delay-sensitive traffic.
⬜ It synchronizes traffic flows using timestamps.

**Explanation:**
Network security includes growth management and protecting resources; ensuring availability is part of it but the question aims for a broader definition. (The first option is more about data availability, the second better captures network security in the context of design and management.)

---

### Question 3

**What characteristic describes spyware?**

⬜ the use of stolen credentials to access private data
⬜ an attack that slows or crashes a device or network service
⬜ a network device that filters access and traffic coming into a network
✅ software that is installed on a user device and collects information about the user

---

### Question 4

**What is a user trying to determine when issuing a `ping 10.1.1.1` command on a PC?**

⬜ if the TCP/IP stack is functioning on the PC without putting traffic on the wire
⬜ what type of device is at the destination
✅ if there is connectivity with the destination device
⬜ the path that traffic will take to reach the destination

---

### Question 5

**Given error: Switch1> config t ^ % Invalid input detected at '^' marker (under “f” of "config")**

What is the problem?

⬜ The entire command, configure terminal, must be used.
⬜ The administrator must connect via the console port to access global configuration mode.
⬜ The administrator is already in global configuration mode.
✅ The administrator must first enter privileged EXEC mode before issuing the command.

**Explanation:**
The `config t` command works only in privileged EXEC mode (`Switch#`). The prompt `Switch1>` indicates user EXEC mode.

---

### Question 6

**What is a characteristic of a switch virtual interface (SVI)?**

⬜ Although it is a virtual interface, it needs to have physical hardware on the device associated with it.
✅ An SVI is created in software and requires a configured IP address and subnet mask in order to provide remote access to the switch.
⬜ SVIs come preconfigured on Cisco switches.
⬜ SVIs do not require the no shutdown command to become enabled.

* ⬜ forwards the new frame appropriate to the medium of that segment of the physical network
* ⬜ determines the best path
* ⬜ de-encapsulates the frame
* ⬜ re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame

**Answer:**

* ⬜ extended star
* ⬜ ring
* ⬜ bus
* ⬜ partial mesh

**Answer:**

* ✅ **extended star**
  **Explanation:** Extended star combines multiple star topologies and is considered a hybrid topology.

---

### Question 18

Although CSMA/CD is still a feature of Ethernet, why is it no longer necessary?

* ⬜ the virtually unlimited availability of IPv6 addresses
* ⬜ the use of CSMA/CA
* ⬜ the use of Gigabit Ethernet speeds
* ⬜ the development of half-duplex switch operation
* ⬜ the use of full-duplex capable Layer 2 switches

**Answer:**

* ✅ **the use of full-duplex capable Layer 2 switches**
  **Explanation:** Full-duplex switches eliminate collisions, making CSMA/CD unnecessary.

---

### Question 19

Why is NAT not needed in IPv6?

* ⬜ The end-to-end connectivity problems caused by NAT are solved because the number of routes increases with the number of nodes connected to the Internet.
* ⬜ The problems induced by NAT applications are solved because the IPv6 header improves packet handling by intermediate routers.
* ⬜ Because IPv6 has integrated security, there is no need to hide the IPv6 addresses of internal networks.
* ⬜ Any host or user can get a public IPv6 network address because the number of available IPv6 addresses is extremely large.

**Answer:**

* ✅ **Any host or user can get a public IPv6 network address because the number of available IPv6 addresses is extremely large.**
  **Explanation:** IPv6 has a huge address space, eliminating the need for address translation.

---

### Question 20

What routing table entry has a next hop address associated with a destination network?

* ⬜ directly-connected routes
* ⬜ C and L source routes
* ⬜ remote routes
* ⬜ local routes

**Answer:**

* ✅ **remote routes**
  **Explanation:** Remote routes require a next-hop address for forwarding packets to destinations outside the local network.

---

### Question 21

If the default gateway is configured incorrectly on the host, what is the impact on communications?

* ⬜ There is no impact on communications.
* ⬜ The host can communicate with other hosts on the local network, but is unable to communicate with hosts on remote networks.
* ⬜ The host is unable to communicate on the local network.
* ⬜ The host can communicate with other hosts on remote networks, but is unable to communicate with hosts on the local network.

**Answer:**

* ✅ **The host can communicate with other hosts on the local network, but is unable to communicate with hosts on remote networks.**
  **Explanation:** Incorrect default gateway prevents routing beyond the local subnet.

---

* ⬜ protocol
* ⬜ header checksum
* ⬜ destination IPv4 address
* ⬜ TTL

**Answer:**

* ✅ **destination IPv4 address**
  **Explanation:** This field contains the IP address of the packet’s intended destination.

---

### Question 23

PC1 sends a frame addressed to PC3. The MAC address table shows port 1 with MAC 12-34-56-78-9A-BF, port 3 with MAC 12-34-56-78-9A-BD. PC3 is connected to port 2 with MAC 12-34-56-78-9A-BE. What will the switch do?

* ⬜ The switch will discard the frame.
* ⬜ The switch will forward the frame only to port 2.
* ⬜ The switch will forward the frame only to ports 1 and 3.
* ⬜ The switch will forward the frame to all ports except port 4.
* ⬜ The switch will forward the frame to all ports.

**Answer:**

* ✅ **The switch will forward the frame to all ports except port 4.**
  **Explanation:** Since PC3’s MAC is not in the table, the switch floods the frame to all ports except the source port (port 4).
