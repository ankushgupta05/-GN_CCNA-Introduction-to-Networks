## final exam

The correct answer is:

**audio conference, financial transactions, web page** ✔️

---

### **Explanation:**

Quality of Service (QoS) prioritizes network traffic based on sensitivity to delay and packet loss:

1. **Audio Conference** → **Highest Priority**

   * Real-time traffic like voice and video is **very sensitive to delay and jitter**.
   * Must be delivered immediately or it becomes unintelligible.

2. **Financial Transactions** → **Medium Priority**

   * Critical for business, but can tolerate slight delays (not real-time).
   * Usually uses TCP, which ensures delivery.

3. **Web Page (HTTP traffic)** → **Lowest Priority**

   * Not time-sensitive.
   * Delay doesn’t impact usability significantly.

---

So, if QoS is implemented properly, it will prioritize traffic in the following order:

**✅ audio conference > financial transactions > web page**

Sure! Here's **Question 3** along with the **correct answer and explanation** clearly formatted:

---

### **Question 3**

**What will happen if the default gateway address is incorrectly configured on a host?**

A. The switch will not forward packets initiated by the host
B. The host will have to use ARP to determine the correct address of the default gateway
C. The host cannot communicate with other hosts in the local network
D. A ping from the host to 127.0.0.1 would not be successful
👉 E. **The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks** ✅

---

### **Correct Answer:**

**E. The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks**

---

### **Explanation:**

* The **default gateway** is the device (typically a router) used by the host to **send traffic to external networks** (i.e., outside its own subnet).
* If the default gateway is misconfigured:

  * The host **can still talk to devices in the same local network** ✅
  * But it **cannot reach devices in other networks** ❌ because it doesn't know where to send those packets.

### **Question 4**

**Which scenario describes a function provided by the transport layer?**

A. A student is using a classroom VoIP phone to call home. The unique identifier burned into the phone is a transport layer address used to contact another network device on the same network.
B. A corporate worker is accessing a web server located on a corporate network. The transport layer formats the screen so the web page appears properly no matter what device is being used to view the web site.
C. A student is playing a short web-based movie with sound. The movie and sound are encoded within the transport layer header.
👉 **D. A student has two web browser windows open in order to access two web sites. The transport layer ensures the correct web page is delivered to the correct browser window.** ✅

---

### **Correct Answer: D**

---

### **Explanation:**

* The **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** is responsible for:

  * **Port numbering** to keep track of multiple applications (like two browser windows).
  * **End-to-end communication**, **segmentation**, **reassembly**, and **flow control**.
* In this case, the **two browser windows** use different ports, and the **transport layer uses port numbers** to deliver the correct data to the right application/browser window.

Sure! Here’s **Question 6** with header fields matched to OSI layers **using layer numbers and names**:

---

### Question 6

Match the header field with the appropriate OSI model layer (number and name):

| Header Field               | OSI Layer Number | OSI Layer Name  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| FCS (Frame Check Sequence) | Layer 2          | Data Link Layer |
| 802.2 Header               | Layer 2          | Data Link Layer |
| Destination MAC Address    | Layer 2          | Data Link Layer |
| Source IP Address          | Layer 3          | Network Layer   |

---

### Explanation:

* **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: Responsible for physical addressing (MAC), framing, error detection (FCS), and LLC (802.2).
* **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**: Responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing.

If you want, I can explain more OSI layers and their roles!
Here’s the matching of the given fields with their OSI layers (number and name):

| Header Field          | OSI Layer Number | OSI Layer Name  |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| TTL (Time To Live)    | Layer 3          | Network Layer   |
| Destination Port No   | Layer 4          | Transport Layer |
| Acknowledgement (ACK) | Layer 4          | Transport Layer |

---

### Explanation:

* **TTL (Time To Live):**
  Found in the IP header at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**. It limits the lifespan of a packet to prevent infinite looping.

* **Destination Port Number:**
  Found in TCP/UDP headers at the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**. It identifies the specific process or service on the destination device.

* **Acknowledgement (ACK):**
  Part of TCP control flags at the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**. It confirms successful receipt of data.

Let's analyze the options to find which subnet includes **192.168.1.96** as a **usable host address**.

---

### Given IP: 192.168.1.96

---

### Option 1: 192.168.1.32/27

* **/27** means subnet mask: 255.255.255.224
* Block size: 32 addresses per subnet (256 - 224 = 32)
* Subnet ranges (start - end):

  * 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.31
  * 192.168.1.32 - 192.168.1.63
  * 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.95
  * 192.168.1.96 - 192.168.1.127

**192.168.1.96** falls in **192.168.1.96 - 192.168.1.127** subnet, *not* in 192.168.1.32/27 subnet.

---

### Option 2: 192.168.1.64/29

* **/29** means subnet mask: 255.255.255.248
* Block size: 8 addresses (256 - 248 = 8)
* Subnet ranges:

  * 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.71
  * 192.168.1.72 - 192.168.1.79
  * ...
* **192.168.1.96** is not in the range 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.71.

---

### Option 3: 192.168.1.64/26

* **/26** means subnet mask: 255.255.255.192
* Block size: 64 addresses (256 - 192 = 64)
* Subnet ranges:

  * 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63
  * 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127

**192.168.1.96** falls within 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127 subnet.
Usable host addresses range from 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.126 (first address is network, last is broadcast).

---

### Option 4: 192.168.1.32/28

* **/28** means subnet mask: 255.255.255.240
* Block size: 16 addresses
* Subnet ranges:

  * 192.168.1.32 - 192.168.1.47
  * 192.168.1.48 - 192.168.1.63
  * ...
* **192.168.1.96** is outside this range.

---

## **Answer: 192.168.1.64/26**

Because this subnet includes 192.168.1.96 as a valid host IP.
