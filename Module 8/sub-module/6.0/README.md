Here are the **correct answers** for the **8.6.2 Module Quiz - Network Layer**:

---

### ✅ **Question 1:**

**Which command can be used on a Windows host to display the routing table?**
**Correct Answer:** `netstat -r`

> ✔️ `netstat -r` displays the routing table on a Windows host.

---

### ✅ **Question 2:**

**What information is added during encapsulation at OSI Layer 3?**
**Correct Answer:** `Source and destination IP address`

> ✔️ Layer 3 (Network layer) adds IP addresses for routing across networks.

---

### ✅ **Question 3:**

**How does the network layer use the MTU value?**
**Correct Answer:** `The MTU is passed to the network layer by the data link layer.`

> ✔️ The network layer receives the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) from the data link layer to determine how much data can be sent in a packet without fragmentation.

---

### ✅ **Question 4:**

**Which characteristic describes an IPv6 enhancement over IPv4?**
**Correct Answer:** `The IPv6 header is simpler than the IPv4 header is, which improves packet handling.`

> ✔️ IPv6 uses a simplified header for faster processing.

---

### ✅ **Question 5:**

**Which statement accurately describes a characteristic of IPv4?**
**Correct Answer:** `IPv4 has a 32-bit address space.​`

> ✔️ IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing about 4.3 billion unique addresses.

---

### ✅ **Question 6:**

**When a router receives a packet, what information must be examined in order for the packet to be forwarded to a remote destination?**
**Correct Answer:** `Destination IP address`

> ✔️ The router checks the destination IP to forward the packet accordingly.

---

### ✅ **Question 7:**

**A computer has to send a packet to a destination host in the same LAN. How will the packet be sent?**
**Correct Answer:** `The packet will be sent directly to the destination host.`

> ✔️ Devices in the same LAN communicate directly without going through the gateway.

---

### ✅ **Question 8:**

**Which IPv4 address can a host use to ping the loopback interface?**
**Correct Answer:** `127.0.0.1`

> ✔️ `127.0.0.1` is the standard loopback address in IPv4.

---

### ✅ **Question 9:**

**When a connectionless protocol is in use at a lower layer of the OSI model, how is missing data detected and retransmitted if necessary?**
**Correct Answer:** `Upper-layer connection-oriented protocols keep track of the data received and can request retransmission from the upper-level protocols on the sending host.`

> ✔️ Protocols like TCP (at Layer 4) handle reliability, not IP (Layer 3).

---

### ✅ **Question 10:**

**What was the reason for the creation and implementation of IPv6?**
**Correct Answer:** `To relieve IPv4 address depletion`

> ✔️ IPv6 was developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

---

### ✅ **Question 11:**

**Which information is used by routers to forward a data packet toward its destination?**
**Correct Answer:** `Destination IP address`

> ✔️ Routers make forwarding decisions based on the destination IP address.

---

### ✅ **Question 12:**

**Which field in an IPv4 packet header will typically stay the same during its transmission?**
**Correct Answer:** `Destination Address`

> ✔️ The destination IP address remains unchanged throughout transmission.

---

### ✅ **Question 13:**

**Which field in an IPv6 packet is used by the router to determine if a packet has expired and should be dropped?**
**Correct Answer:** `Hop Limit`

> ✔️ IPv6 replaces the IPv4 TTL field with **Hop Limit** to control packet lifetime.
