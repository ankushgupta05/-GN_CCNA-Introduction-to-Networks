In **Module 8.0.2: Network Layer**, you will learn how routers and hosts use network layer protocols to ensure end-to-end communication across interconnected networks. Here's a breakdown of what you'll learn in each topic:

| **Topic Title**                   | **Topic Objective**                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Network Layer Characteristics** | Explain how the network layer uses IP protocols (like IPv4 and IPv6) for reliable communications between devices.              |
| **IPv4 Packet**                   | Explain the role and importance of major header fields in an IPv4 packet, such as source IP, destination IP, TTL, etc.         |
| **IPv6 Packet**                   | Understand the structure and purpose of major header fields in an IPv6 packet, and how they differ from IPv4.                  |
| **How a Host Routes**             | Learn how devices (hosts) use their routing tables to send packets to the correct destination network.                         |
| **Router Routing Tables**         | Explain how routers use routing tables, including what each field in a routing entry means and how routing decisions are made. |

Would you like a visual diagram of an IPv4 vs IPv6 packet structure to help you better understand this?
