### **IPv4 Packet Header Fields**

| **Field**                        | **Size (bits)** | **Description**                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version**                      | 4               | Indicates the IP version. For IPv4, this is always set to `0100`.                                                                           |
| **Differentiated Services (DS)** | 8               | Used for packet priority and quality of service. <br> - First 6 bits: **DSCP** <br> - Last 2 bits: **ECN**                                  |
| **Time to Live (TTL)**           | 8               | Limits packet's lifetime. Decrements by 1 at each router. If it reaches 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP error is sent to the sender. |
| **Protocol**                     | 8               | Identifies the next-layer protocol:<br> - ICMP (1), TCP (6), UDP (17), etc.                                                                 |
| **Header Checksum**              | 16              | Used to detect errors in the IPv4 header. Recalculated at each hop due to TTL decrement.                                                    |
| **Source IPv4 Address**          | 32              | IP address of the sender. Always a **unicast** address.                                                                                     |
| **Destination IPv4 Address**     | 32              | IP address of the receiver. Can be **unicast**, **multicast**, or **broadcast**.                                                            |
| **Internet Header Length (IHL)** | 4               | Specifies the header length in 32-bit words. Used to determine where the data starts.                                                       |
| **Total Length**                 | 16              | Total length of the IP packet (header + data).                                                                                              |
| **Identification**               | 16              | Helps identify fragments of the same original packet.                                                                                       |
| **Flags**                        | 3               | Controls fragmentation. For example, the "Don't Fragment (DF)" and "More Fragments (MF)" flags.                                             |
| **Fragment Offset**              | 13              | Used to reassemble fragmented packets in the correct order.                                                                                 |
| **Options and Padding**          | Variable        | Rarely used. Extra features, if needed. Padding ensures the header is a multiple of 32 bits.                                                |

### **Key Notes**

* **Source/Destination Addresses**: Most referenced; these usually stay the same throughout the packet‚Äôs journey.
* **TTL and Header Checksum**: Changed at each router.
* **Fragmentation**: Handled using Identification, Flags, and Fragment Offset.
* **Options**: Advanced usage, not commonly applied.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the **"Check Your Understanding - IPv4 Packet"** questions with correct answers and explanations for each option:

---

### **Question 1:**

**What are the two most commonly referenced fields in an IPv4 packet header that indicate where the packet is coming from and where it is going? (Choose two.)**

‚úÖ **Correct Answers:**

* ‚úÖ **Destination IP address**
* ‚úÖ **Source IP address**

üìò **Explanation:**

* These fields contain the 32-bit IPv4 addresses of the **sender (source)** and **receiver (destination)**, helping routers and devices know where the packet came from and where it's going. These are the most commonly referenced fields in IP packet analysis.

‚ùå **Incorrect Options:**

* **Protocol** ‚Äì This identifies the next-layer protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP), **not the source or destination**.
* **Time to Live** ‚Äì TTL limits the lifespan of a packet; it doesn‚Äôt tell you where the packet is from or going.
* **Differentiated Services (DS)** ‚Äì Used for packet priority and QoS, not location info.

---

### **Question 2:**

**Which statement is correct about IPv4 packet header fields?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**

* ‚úÖ **The source and destination IPv4 addresses remain the same while travelling from source to destination.**

üìò **Explanation:**

* The source and destination addresses are **constant** throughout the packet‚Äôs journey. Routers use them to route the packet correctly.

‚ùå **Incorrect Options:**

* **The Time to Live field is used to determine the priority of each packet.**
  ‚úò Wrong ‚Äì **TTL** limits lifetime, **DS** determines priority.
* **The Total Length and Header Checksum fields are used to reorder a fragmented packet.**
  ‚úò Wrong ‚Äì **Identification**, **Flags**, and **Fragment Offset** are used for reordering.
* **The Version field identifies the next level protocol.**
  ‚úò Wrong ‚Äì **Protocol field** identifies the next-layer protocol; Version indicates IPv4 (0100).

---

### **Question 3:**

**Which field is used to detect corruption in the IPv4 header?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**

* ‚úÖ **Header Checksum**

üìò **Explanation:**

* The Header Checksum field helps routers verify the integrity of the IPv4 **header**. If there's a mismatch after recalculation, it means the header is corrupted.

‚ùå **Incorrect Options:**

* **Time to Live** ‚Äì TTL is for limiting packet life, not for error checking.
* **Protocol** ‚Äì Identifies the type of transport-layer data; not related to corruption detection.
* **Differentiated Services (DS)** ‚Äì Used for priority/QoS; not for error detection.

---

### **Question 4:**

**Which field includes common values such as ICMP (1), TCP (6), and UDP (17)?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**

* ‚úÖ **Protocol**

üìò **Explanation:**

* The **Protocol** field tells which transport or upper-layer protocol the data should be passed to. Example values: ICMP = 1, TCP = 6, UDP = 17.

‚ùå **Incorrect Options:**

* **Header Checksum** ‚Äì Used for error detection, not protocol identification.
* **Time to Live** ‚Äì Used to limit packet‚Äôs life; unrelated to upper-layer protocols.
* **Differentiated Services (DS)** ‚Äì For prioritization and QoS, not protocol type.
