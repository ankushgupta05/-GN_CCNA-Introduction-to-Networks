| 1  | A router boots and enters setup mode. What is the reason for this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | âœ… The configuration file is missing from NVRAM.                                                                                                | If the startup configuration is missing in NVRAM, the router enters setup mode to guide initial config. |
| 2  | Which command is used to encrypt all passwords in a router configuration file?                                                                                                                                                                                                            | âœ… `Router_A(config)# service password-encryption`                                                                                              | This command encrypts all existing plaintext passwords in the running config.                           |
| 3  | Company policy requires using the most secure method to safeguard access to the privileged exec and configuration mode on the routers. The privileged exec password is `trustknow1`.

| 4  | What will be the response from the router after the command `router(config)# hostname portsmouth` is entered?                                                                                                                                                                             | âœ… `portsmouth(config)#`                                                                                                                        | After assigning a new hostname, the CLI prompt reflects the new hostname.                               |
| 5  | An administrator is configuring a new router to permit out-of-band management access. Which set of commands will allow the required login using a password of `cisco`?                                                                                                                    | âœ… `Router(config)# line vty 0 4`<br>`Router(config-line)# password cisco`<br>`Router(config-line)# login`                                      | These commands allow remote VTY access and require the password `cisco`.                                |
