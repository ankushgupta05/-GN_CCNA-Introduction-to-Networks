# 4.2.1 – Physical Layer Standards

## Overview
Previously, you explored the physical layer's role in networking. This section provides deeper insight into the **components**, **media**, and **standards** that ensure compatibility and reliable communication across networks.

## Key Concepts

- **Upper layers of the OSI model** (like Application, Transport, etc.) use **software-defined protocols**, governed by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**.
- The **Physical Layer**, by contrast, is implemented using **hardware** and is governed by **engineering standards organizations**.

### Major Standards Organizations for the Physical Layer

| Organization | Full Name                                                              | Region / Role                               |

# 4.2.2 – Physical Components

## Three Key Functional Areas of Physical Layer Standards:
1. **Physical Components**
2. **Encoding**
3. **Signaling**

---

## 🧩 Physical Components

These include all **tangible hardware** used to transmit bits in the network:

| Component Type      | Examples                                            |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Network Interfaces  | NICs (Network Interface Cards)                      |
| Interfaces/Ports    | Ethernet ports, serial interfaces                   |
| Connectors          | RJ-45, SC, LC                                       |
| Cables              | UTP, STP, fiber optic                               |
| Devices             | Routers (e.g., Cisco 1941), switches, hubs          |

### 🔌 Example:
On a **Cisco 1941 router**, the physical ports and connectors are implemented based on physical layer standards, ensuring compatibility with industry-standard cables and devices.

> 💡 **Daily Life Analogy**:  
> Think of physical components like different **plugs and sockets** used around the world. Without standards (like 2-pin, 3-pin), electronic devices wouldn’t work universally. Networking hardware faces the same issue — that’s why physical layer standards are essential!

# 4.2.3 – Encoding (Line Encoding)

## 🧠 What is Encoding?

Encoding is the method of converting a stream of binary data (`0`s and `1`s) into a predefined **code pattern** that can be recognized by both the **sender** and **receiver**.

> 📌 Think of encoding like Morse code: a series of **dots and dashes** used to represent letters and words. Similarly, encoding in networks uses **voltage changes** or **light pulses** to represent bits.

---

## 🔄 Manchester Encoding (Example)

Manchester encoding is a type of digital encoding used in older Ethernet standards (like 10BASE-T). In this method:

- A **0 bit** is represented by a **high-to-low** voltage transition.
- A **1 bit** is represented by a **low-to-high** voltage transition.
- The **transition happens in the middle** of each bit period.

### ⚙️ Used In:
- **10 Mbps Ethernet** (10BASE-T)
- Faster versions like 100BASE-TX use **4B/5B encoding**
- 1000BASE-T uses **8B/10B encoding**

---

### 🖼️ Visualization Example:
> **Bit Stream:** `0 1 0 0 1 1 0`  
> At the midpoint of each bit period:
> - Voltage **drops** for 0  
> - Voltage **rises** for 1  

Imagine a line graph of voltage over time, with clear "up" and "down" transitions marking each bit. This predictable pattern helps devices understand where each bit starts and ends.

---

# 4.2.4 – Signaling

## 🔊 What is Signaling?

Signaling refers to the method used by the physical layer to **transmit bits** (0s and 1s) over a medium — using electrical, optical, or wireless signals.

> ✨ In simple terms, signaling decides **how a 1 or 0 looks** physically when sent through a wire or wirelessly.

---

## 🧭 Examples of Signaling:

| Media Type        | Signaling Method Example                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Electrical (Copper) | Change in voltage level                        |
| Optical (Fiber)     | Pulse of light (long = 1, short = 0)           |
| Wireless            | Change in radio wave frequency or amplitude    |

---

## 🧩 Real-Life Analogy:

Think of **Morse Code** again:
- **Long beep** = 1  
- **Short beep** = 0  

Ships used this method to send messages with **light flashes** or **sound pulses**. Similarly, in networks, devices use signals to convey binary data.

---

> 🧠 **Key Insight:** Encoding defines *how to prepare the bits*, and signaling defines *how to transmit them*.





# 4.2.5 – Bandwidth

## 📶 What is Bandwidth?

**Bandwidth** refers to the *capacity* of a network medium to carry data — not the speed at which the bits travel.

> 📌 **Think of bandwidth like a water pipe**: a wider pipe carries more water at once, just as higher bandwidth carries more bits at once.

---

## ⚙️ Digital Bandwidth Is Measured In:

| Abbreviation | Full Form              | Equivalent Bits per Second   |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **bps**      | Bits per second         | 1 bit per second              |
| **Kbps**     | Kilobits per second     | 1,000 bps (10³ bps)           |
| **Mbps**     | Megabits per second     | 1,000,000 bps (10⁶ bps)       |
| **Gbps**     | Gigabits per second     | 1,000,000,000 bps (10⁹ bps)   |
| **Tbps**     | Terabits per second     | 1,000,000,000,000 bps (10¹²)  |

---

## ⚡ Bandwidth vs. Speed: What's the Difference?

Although people often say "internet speed," **bandwidth is not how *fast* bits travel** — they always move at about the same speed (like the speed of electricity or light). What differs is **how many bits** are sent per second.

### 📌 Example:
- In **10 Mbps Ethernet** and **100 Mbps Ethernet**, both send bits at the speed of electricity, but **100 Mbps Ethernet** sends **10× more bits** in the same amount of time.

---

## 🧠 What Affects Bandwidth?

1. 🧪 **Properties of the physical medium**  
   (e.g., copper vs. fiber-optic)

2. 🔁 **Encoding and signaling technologies**  
   (e.g., Manchester encoding vs. 8B/10B)

3. 🌐 **Physical limitations and physics**  
   (e.g., noise, interference, resistance)

---

## 🚿 Real-Life Analogy: Water Pipes

| Network Concept  | Water Analogy                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Bandwidth        | Width of the pipe (volume capacity)  |
| Signal (bit)     | Drops of water                       |
| Speed of signal  | Speed of water flow (usually constant) |

---

> 📎 **Conclusion:** Bandwidth is about how *much* data can be transferred per second, not how *fast* it moves.




# 4.2.6 – Bandwidth Terminology

When evaluating how well data travels over a network, we use three key terms:

---

## 🚀 1. Latency

**Latency** is the *time delay* for data to travel from one point to another.

> 📌 **Think of latency like travel time**: If you're sending a message from Delhi to Mumbai, the latency is the time it takes to get there.

- Latency includes:
  - Signal travel time
  - Processing delays
  - Queuing delays
  - Transmission delays

---

## 📊 2. Throughput

**Throughput** is the **actual amount of data** (in bits) successfully transferred over a network in a given time.

> 📌 **Think of throughput like water flow**: How much water (data) gets through the pipe (network) per second.

- It is often **less than** the available **bandwidth** because of:
  - Traffic congestion
  - Network device limitations
  - Protocol overhead

---

## 🟢 3. Goodput

**Goodput** is the **amount of useful data** (excluding overhead) delivered per second.

> 📌 **Think of goodput like drinkable water**: It’s the clean water you can actually use — not the total water including impurities or packaging.

- Goodput = Throughput − Overhead (e.g., retransmissions, headers, acknowledgments)

---

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Term       | Definition                                                  | Analogy                  | Relative Size            |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Latency**| Time delay in data travel                                   | Travel time               | (Not measured in bits/sec)|
| **Throughput**| Total bits transferred per second                        | Water through the pipe    | ≤ Bandwidth               |
| **Goodput** | Useful data transferred per second                         | Clean/drinkable water     | ≤ Throughput              |

---

## 🔍 Real-Life Example

You pay for **100 Mbps** internet:

- **Bandwidth**: 100 Mbps (what the provider offers)
- **Throughput**: 85 Mbps (what you actually get, due to congestion)
- **Goodput**: 75 Mbps (actual usable data, excluding retransmissions and headers)

---

> ✅ **Tip:** When testing your internet speed, the number you see is usually **throughput**, not bandwidth or goodput.
