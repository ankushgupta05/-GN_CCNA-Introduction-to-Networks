|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | True or false? The physical layer is only concerned with wired network connections. | - True<br>- False                                                                       | **False**    | The physical layer is responsible for both wired **and** wireless media.                        |
| 2   | True or false? When a frame is encoded by the physical layer, all bits are sent over the media at the same time. | - True<br>- False                                                    | **False**    | Bits are transmitted **sequentially**, one at a time, not all at once.                         |
| 3   | The physical layer of the receiving device passes bits up to which higher level layer? | - Application<br>- Presentation<br>- Network<br>- Data link                              | **Data link**| The physical layer passes bits to the **data link layer**, which then assembles them into frames.|
| 4   | What PDU is received by the physical layer for encoding and transmission? | - Frame<br>- Segment<br>- Packet                                                         | **Frame**    | The physical layer receives a **frame** from the data link layer and encodes it into bits.      |
