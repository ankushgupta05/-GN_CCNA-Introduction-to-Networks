### 📌 **4.5.1 Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling**

| Feature          | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transmission** | Sends data over longer distances at higher bandwidths than copper cables                    |
| **Signal Type**  | Light impulses, not electrical signals                                                      |
| **Material**     | Very pure glass, hair-thin, flexible                                                        |
| **Immunity**     | Immune to **EMI** (Electromagnetic Interference) and **RFI** (Radio Frequency Interference) |
| **Attenuation**  | Very low (minimal signal loss)                                                              |
| **Analogy**      | Like a laser beam through a mirrored paper tube (waveguide/light pipe)                      |

### 📌 **4.5.2 Types of Fiber Media**

| Type                        | Description                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-mode Fiber (SMF)** | Small core; uses laser light; suitable for **long-distance** transmissions (e.g., between cities)   |
| **Multimode Fiber (MMF)**   | Larger core; uses LED light; suitable for **shorter distances** (e.g., within a campus or building) |

#### 🔍 Multimode Fiber (MMF) Details:

* **Core Diameter:** 50 to 62.5 µm
* **Cladding Diameter:** 125 µm
* **Light Source:** LED
* **Distance Support:** Up to 550 meters at 10 Gbps
* **Cost:** Cheaper due to LED use
* **Common Usage:** Local Area Networks (LANs)

### 📌 **4.5.3 Fiber-Optic Cabling Usage in Industries**

| Industry Type                | Use Case                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enterprise Networks**      | Backbone connections between switches, routers, and data centers        |
| **Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH)** | Always-on broadband for homes and small businesses                      |
| **Long-Haul Networks**       | Service provider connections between cities and countries               |
| **Submarine Cable Networks** | Undersea cables for high-speed, high-capacity international connections |
