### ✅ **4.3.1 Characteristics of Copper Cabling**

| Concept                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Common Use**               | Copper cabling is the most widely used in networks due to its low cost, ease of installation, and low resistance.                                      |
| **Transmission Method**      | Data is transmitted as **electrical pulses**.                                                                                                          |
| **Limitation - Attenuation** | Signal **deteriorates over distance** – this is called **signal attenuation**. Distance limits must be followed per standards.                         |
| **Interference Sources**     | **EMI/RFI** (from devices like fluorescent lights, motors) and **crosstalk** (interference from adjacent wires).                                       |
| **Crosstalk**                | Happens when magnetic fields from one wire affect the adjacent wire, altering signals.                                                                 |
| **Result of Interference**   | A computer may **misread bits**, e.g., a 0 may flip to 1.                                                                                              |
| **Prevention Measures**      | Metallic **shielding**, **twisting wires**, using **suitable cable categories**, and **proper cable handling/termination** help minimize interference. |

### ✅ **4.3.2 Types of Copper Cabling**

| Cable Type                        | Description                                              | Construction                                                                 | Use Case                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP)** | Most common cable type. Inexpensive and easy to install. | 4 twisted wire pairs, no shielding.                                          | LANs, telephony.                                |
| **Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP)**   | Reduces EMI/RFI better than UTP.                         | Twisted pairs with **foil shielding**.                                       | Industrial environments with high interference. |
| **Coaxial Cable**                 | Used in cable TV, legacy networks.                       | Single copper conductor, surrounded by insulation and **braided shielding**. | Broadband internet, cable networks.             |
