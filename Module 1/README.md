# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking

## 🔍 What is Peer-to-Peer Networking?

A **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** network is a type of computer network where all devices (called "peers") are connected directly. Each device can act as both a **client** and a **server**, meaning they can both request and provide services.

## 🖥️ Simple Example

Imagine a small home or office network:

- **Computer A** is connected to a **printer** and shares it.
- **Computer B** shares **files**.
- Both are connected through a simple network (like Wi-Fi or LAN).

Now, **Computer A** can print documents and also get files from **Computer B**, and vice versa. No central server is needed.

## ✅ Advantages of P2P Networking

- Easy to set up
- Less complex to manage
- Lower cost (no need for dedicated servers or expensive hardware)
- Ideal for small tasks like:
  - File sharing
  - Printer sharing

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of P2P Networking

- No centralized control or administration
- Less secure
- Not scalable for large networks
- Slower performance (since each device does multiple tasks)

---

## 📌 Use Case

Best suited for **small offices** or **home networks** where users need basic file or printer sharing without complex setup.
