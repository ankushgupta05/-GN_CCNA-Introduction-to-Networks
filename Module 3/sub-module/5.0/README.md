## üß± OSI Model Layers with Protocols (with Simple Examples)

| Layer No. | Layer Name       | Function (Simple)                                            | Daily Life Example                              | Example Protocols                                  |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **7**     | **Application**  | What the user sees and interacts with (apps, user interface) | You open Gmail to send an email                 | **HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP**              |
| **6**     | **Presentation** | Translates data format, encryption, compression              | English to Hindi translator                     | **SSL, TLS, JPEG, MPEG, ASCII**                    |
| **5**     | **Session**      | Starts and ends communication sessions                       | Starting and ending a phone call                | **NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, SAP**                        |
| **4**     | **Transport**    | Reliable or fast delivery of data                            | Courier service that ensures delivery           | **TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)**                     |
| **3**     | **Network**      | Chooses the path for data across networks                    | GPS finding best route to home                  | **IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP**                     |
| **2**     | **Data Link**    | Moves data on local network (between devices)                | Apartment gate security - verifies local access | **Ethernet, PPP, Switch MAC, VLAN**                |
| **1**     | **Physical**     | Sends data as bits over cables, Wi-Fi                        | The actual roads and cables                     | **USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (802.11), Ethernet cable** |

## üåê TCP/IP Model Layers with Protocols (and Simple Examples)

| Layer No. | Layer Name         | Function (Simple Explanation)                             | Daily Life Example                     | Example Protocols                                 |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **4**     | **Application**    | User interaction, data representation, and services       | Sending an email or browsing a website | **HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP, SNMP**       |
| **3**     | **Transport**      | Reliable or fast data delivery between devices            | Choosing between fast or safe courier  | **TCP (reliable), UDP (faster but no guarantee)** |
| **2**     | **Internet**       | Chooses best route for data to travel                     | GPS finds best route to destination    | **IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP**                    |
| **1**     | **Network Access** | Handles physical transmission through media (cables/WiFi) | Actual road, wires, or Wi-Fi signal    | **Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), DSL, MAC addresses**  |

### üìå Key Differences from OSI Model

* OSI has **7 layers**, TCP/IP has **4 layers**.
* OSI separates **Presentation** and **Session** layers, but TCP/IP combines them into the **Application layer**.
* **OSI is a conceptual model**, while **TCP/IP is based on real protocols**.
