Here is the **OSI Model with associated protocols** at each layer, explained in a **simple daily life way**, and shown in a clean table format:

## ðŸ§± OSI Model Layers with Protocols (with Simple Examples)

| Layer No. | Layer Name       | Function (Simple)                                            | Daily Life Example                              | Example Protocols                                  |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **7**     | **Application**  | What the user sees and interacts with (apps, user interface) | You open Gmail to send an email                 | **HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP**              |
| **6**     | **Presentation** | Translates data format, encryption, compression              | English to Hindi translator                     | **SSL, TLS, JPEG, MPEG, ASCII**                    |
| **5**     | **Session**      | Starts and ends communication sessions                       | Starting and ending a phone call                | **NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, SAP**                        |
| **4**     | **Transport**    | Reliable or fast delivery of data                            | Courier service that ensures delivery           | **TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)**                     |
| **3**     | **Network**      | Chooses the path for data across networks                    | GPS finding best route to home                  | **IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP**                     |
| **2**     | **Data Link**    | Moves data on local network (between devices)                | Apartment gate security - verifies local access | **Ethernet, PPP, Switch MAC, VLAN**                |
| **1**     | **Physical**     | Sends data as bits over cables, Wi-Fi                        | The actual roads and cables                     | **USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (802.11), Ethernet cable** |

Let me know if you want the **TCP/IP vs OSI comparison table** too!



3.5.3 The TCP/IP Protocol Model
The TCP/IP protocol model for internetwork communications was created in the early 1970s and is sometimes referred to as the internet model. This type of model closely matches the structure of a particular protocol suite. The TCP/IP model is a protocol model because it describes the functions that occur at each layer of protocols within the TCP/IP suite. TCP/IP is also used as a reference model. The table shows details about each layer of the TCP/IP model.
TCP/IP Model Layer
Description
4- Application
Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.
3- Transport
Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks.
2- Internet
Determines the best path through the network.
1-Network Access
Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network.
The definitions of the standard and the TCP/IP protocols are discussed in a public forum and defined in a publicly available set of IETF RFCs. An RFC is authored by networking engineers and sent to other IETF members for comments.
