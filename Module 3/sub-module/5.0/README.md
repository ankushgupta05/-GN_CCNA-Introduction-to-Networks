### üìå Key Differences from OSI Model

* OSI has **7 layers**, TCP/IP has **4 layers**.
* OSI separates **Presentation** and **Session** layers, but TCP/IP combines them into the **Application layer**.
* **OSI is a conceptual model**, while **TCP/IP is based on real protocols**.

### üß† Key Takeaways:

* **OSI Layers 5, 6, and 7** are merged into **TCP/IP's Application layer**.
* Both models **align well at Transport and Network layers**.
* **TCP/IP is a practical protocol model**, while **OSI is more conceptual** and used for reference and teaching.
* The **lower two layers in OSI (Data Link and Physical)** are referred to as a single **Network Access layer in TCP/IP**.
