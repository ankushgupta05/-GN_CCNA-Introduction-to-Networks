Here's a simplified and structured summary of **Section 3.7.1 & 3.7.2 - Addresses** based on your provided content:

---

## 📦 **3.7.1 - Addresses Overview**

In a network, **addresses** are critical to ensure data reaches the correct destination. Two OSI layers manage this delivery:

### 🔹 **Network Layer (Layer 3)**

* Uses **IP addresses** (logical addresses).
* Responsible for end-to-end **packet delivery** from source to destination—across networks.

### 🔹 **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

* Uses **MAC addresses** (physical addresses).
* Responsible for **frame delivery** between devices on the same local network (like NIC-to-NIC).

### 📚 **Layer Functions and Their Data:**

| Layer            | Information Provided                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Physical**     | Timing and synchronization bits            |
| **Data Link**    | Source and destination **MAC addresses**   |
| **Network**      | Source and destination **IP addresses**    |
| **Transport**    | Source and destination **port numbers**    |
| **Upper Layers** | Encoded application data (e.g., HTTP, FTP) |

## 🌐 **3.7.2 - Layer 3 Logical Address (IP Address)**

### 🧭 What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** is a **logical address** used by Layer 3 (network layer) to identify:

* **Source** of the data (sender)
* **Destination** of the data (receiver)

Even if a packet crosses multiple routers, the **source and destination IP addresses remain the same.**

---

### 🖥️ **Example Scenario**

* **Source:** PC1 with IP `192.168.1.110`
* **Destination:** Web Server with IP `172.16.1.99`
* **Path:** PC1 ➡️ R1 ➡️ R2 ➡️ Web Server

➡️ The **IP packet header** always shows:

* **Source IP:** `192.168.1.110`
* **Destination IP:** `172.16.1.99`

---

### 🧩 **Structure of an IP Address**

| Part                                              | Description                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Portion** (IPv4) / **Prefix** (IPv6)    | Identifies the network the device belongs to  |
| **Host Portion** (IPv4) / **Interface ID** (IPv6) | Identifies the specific device on the network |

> 📌 **Subnet Mask** (IPv4) or **Prefix Length** (IPv6) helps determine which part is the network and which is the host.

Here is a concise summary of **Sections 3.7.1 to 3.7.4** on network addressing:

---

### 🔹 3.7.1 **Addresses Overview**

* Communication over networks requires both **network-layer** and **data link-layer** addressing.
* **Network Layer (Layer 3):**

  * Uses **IP addresses**.
  * Responsible for delivering packets from the original source to the final destination (even across different networks).
* **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**

  * Uses **MAC addresses**.
  * Responsible for delivering frames between two devices on the **same local network** (e.g., PC to switch, or switch to router).

---

### 🔹 3.7.2 **Layer 3 Logical Address (IP Address)**

* **IP addresses** consist of:

  * **Source IP address** – The sender’s address.
  * **Destination IP address** – The receiver’s address.
* These remain **unchanged** throughout the journey from source to destination.
* An IP address includes:

  * **Network portion** (identifies the network).
  * **Host portion** (identifies the specific device).
* A **subnet mask** or **prefix length** helps distinguish between the two portions.

---

### 🔹 3.7.3 **Devices on the Same Network**

* If two devices (e.g., PC1 and FTP Server) are on the **same network**, only **one data link (Ethernet) frame** is needed.
* Example:

  * **PC1**: IP - `192.168.1.110`, MAC - `AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA`
  * **FTP Server**: IP - `192.168.1.9`, MAC - `CC-CC-CC-CC-CC-CC`
* Since the network portion (`192.168.1`) is the same, they can directly communicate using **MAC addresses**.

---

### 🔹 3.7.4 **Data Link Layer Address Role – Same Network**

* In a same-network scenario:

  * **Source MAC**: Sender’s Ethernet NIC MAC (e.g., PC1: `AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA`)
  * **Destination MAC**: Receiver’s MAC (e.g., FTP Server: `CC-CC-CC-CC-CC-CC`)
* **MAC addresses** are **burned into the NIC** and used only for local delivery (hop-by-hop).
* **IP addresses** still encapsulate the data and provide end-to-end logical delivery.

Certainly! Here's the explanation of the process **“Devices on a Remote Network”** using the **same format** and structure you've provided:

---

### 3.7.5 Devices on a Remote Network

But what are the roles of the network layer address and the data link layer address when a device is communicating with a device on a remote network? In this example, we have a client computer, **PC1**, communicating with a server, named **Web Server**, on a different IP network.

---

### 3.7.6 Role of the Network Layer Addresses

When the sender of the packet is on a different network from the receiver, the **source and destination IP addresses** will represent hosts on **different networks**. This is indicated by the **network portion** of the IP address of the destination host.

* **Source IPv4 address** – The IPv4 address of the sending device, the client computer **PC1**: `192.168.1.110`.
* **Destination IPv4 address** – The IPv4 address of the receiving device, the server **Web Server**: `172.16.1.99`.

> Notice in the figure that the **network portion** of the source and destination IPv4 addresses are **on different networks**.

---

**The figure** shows the data link Ethernet frame header and network layer IP packet header for information flowing from a **source on one network** to a **destination on a different network**.

#### Network Topology:

* **PC1**

  * IP: `192.168.1.110`
  * MAC: `AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA`
* **R1 (Router)**

  * IP: `192.168.1.1`
  * MAC: `11-11-11-11-11-11`
* **R2 (Router)**

  * IP: `172.16.1.1`
  * MAC: `22-22-22-22-22-22`
* **Web Server**

  * IP: `172.16.1.99`
  * MAC: `AB-CD-EF-12-34-56`

#### Packet Headers:

| Layer             | Header Details                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Link**     | **Ethernet Frame Header** <br> - **Destination MAC**: `11-11-11-11-11-11` (R1) <br> - **Source MAC**: `AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA` (PC1) |
| **Network Layer** | **IP Packet Header** <br> - **Source IP**: `192.168.1.110` <br> - **Destination IP**: `172.16.1.99`                             |
| **Payload**       | Data                                                                                                                            |

### 3.7.7 Role of the Data Link Layer Addresses – Different IP Networks

When the sender and receiver of the IP packet are **on different networks**, the Ethernet **data link frame cannot be sent directly** to the destination host. This is because the host is not on the same local network.

Instead, the Ethernet frame is sent to the **default gateway (router)**. In our example, the **default gateway is R1**, which shares the same local network as **PC1**.

#### Addressing:

* **Source MAC address** – The MAC address of **PC1**: `AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA`.
* **Destination MAC address** – Since the destination (Web Server) is on a different network, PC1 sends the frame to the **MAC address of R1**, the default gateway: `11-11-11-11-11-11`.

> This allows the Ethernet frame to reach R1, which will then forward the IP packet toward the final destination.

---

**Summary Flow:**

* **PC1** constructs a frame:

  * **Dest MAC**: `R1`
  * **Source MAC**: `PC1`
  * **Dest IP**: `Web Server`
  * **Source IP**: `PC1`

* **R1** receives the frame, reads the IP header, and forwards the packet through other routers or networks until it reaches **Web Server**.

---

> 💡 **Important:** Every host must have the IP address of its default gateway configured. This ensures packets destined for remote networks can be properly forwarded.
