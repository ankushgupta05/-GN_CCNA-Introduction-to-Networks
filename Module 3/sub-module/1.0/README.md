| Topic                       | What It Means                                                               | Simple Example                                                                                          |

| **Protocols**               | Rules that decide how data is sent and received in a network.               | Like how people follow grammar rules to talk, computers follow protocols to communicate.                |
| **Protocol Suites**         | A group of protocols that work together.                                    | The TCP/IP suite is like a team of players in a football game, each with a role.                        |
| **Standards Organizations** | Groups that create and maintain these protocols for global use.             | Like how the ISO sets quality standards for products, they set rules for networks.                      |
| **Reference Models**        | OSI and TCP/IP models show how communication happens in layers.             | Like how a letter goes through steps‚Äîwriting, packing, sending, receiving‚Äîdata does the same in layers. |
| **Data Encapsulation**      | Wrapping data in layers before sending.                                     | Like wrapping a gift in boxes‚Äîeach layer has info for its journey.                                      |
| **Data Access**             | How devices access shared files, printers, or internet through the network. | Like accessing a shared folder on your college network from your laptop.                                |




Based on the PDF you uploaded (`3.0.3-class-activity---design-a-communications-system.pdf`), here's a well-formatted and simplified `README.md` response for the class activity:

## üõ†Ô∏è 3.0.3 Class Activity ‚Äì Design a Communications System

### üìö Objective:

Explain how **protocols** and **standards organizations** help different systems (or people) communicate and work together, even when there are differences‚Äîlike language.

---

### üß© Scenario Summary:

You bought a new car. It started having issues.
You went to a nearby recommended repair shop, but **the mechanics speak another language**.
You must find a way to explain the car problem and make sure they **fix it correctly**.

### ‚úÖ My Communication Model Design

| Step | Component    | Description                                  | Example                                                     |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Sender**   | Person sending the message.                  | You, explaining the car issue.                              |
| 2    | **Encoding** | Convert message into understandable form.    | Use gestures, sounds, drawings, or a translation app.       |
| 3    | **Medium**   | The method used to send the message.         | Phone translator, sketching, showing a video of the issue.  |
| 4    | **Receiver** | Person receiving the message.                | Mechanic listening to your explanation.                     |
| 5    | **Decoding** | Mechanic translates and tries to understand. | Mechanic uses their knowledge to interpret what you mean.   |
| 6    | **Feedback** | Confirmation or response from receiver.      | Mechanic repeats the issue or shows you what they will fix. |
| 7    | **Noise**    | Anything that disrupts communication.        | Language barrier, loud environment, unclear gestures.       |

---

### üîÑ Reflection Question:

**What steps did you identify as important to communicating your repair request? Justify your answer.**

**Answer:**

1. **Using a translator app or images** ‚Äì This helps break the language barrier.
2. **Confirming understanding** ‚Äì I would ask the mechanic to repeat what they understood or point to the part to be fixed.
3. **Avoiding distractions** ‚Äì I would ensure we talk in a quiet place so noise doesn't affect communication.
4. **Following up** ‚Äì I would check the repair plan before they start.

These steps are important because they reduce **misunderstandings** and ensure the **right problem gets fixed**, just like **network protocols** reduce communication errors in data transmission.

üñß 3.1.5 Network Protocol Requirements
Computers also follow rules, just like people, when they "talk" on a network. These rules are called protocols.

Here‚Äôs what network protocols must handle:

| Rule                             | Example                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Message Encoding**             | Converting text into 1s and 0s.                     |
| **Formatting and Encapsulation** | Adding structure so devices understand the message. |
| **Message Size**                 | Breaking big files into smaller chunks.             |
| **Timing**                       | Sending and receiving at the right time.            |
| **Delivery Options**             | Choosing whether it‚Äôs one-to-one or one-to-many.    |
