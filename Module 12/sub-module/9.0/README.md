| -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîò `2001:DB8:0:AB00::1234` | ‚úÖ **Correct** | `::` replaces the **longest contiguous block** of zero groups (`0000:0000:0000`). |
| `2001:DB8:0:AB::1234`      | ‚ùå Incorrect   | `AB00` ‚â† `AB`, this changes the value of the original address.                    |

| `2001:DB8::/64`             | ‚ùå Incorrect   | Still too short; it only covers up to the first 32 bits.             |
| ‚úÖ `2001:DB8:D15:EA::/64`    | ‚úÖ **Correct** | A `/64` prefix includes the **first 4 hextets**.                     |
| `2001:DB8:D15:EA:CC44::/64` | ‚ùå Incorrect   | Too long‚Äî`CC44` is part of the interface ID, not the network prefix. |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ `It tests the internal configuration of an IPv6 host.`            | ‚úÖ **Correct** | `::1` is the IPv6 **loopback address**, used to test local IP stack. |
| `It tests the broadcast capability of all hosts on the subnet.`     | ‚ùå Incorrect   | IPv6 **does not use broadcast**.                                     |

Here are the **correct answers with explanations** for questions 8‚Äì15 of your IPv6 module quiz:

---

### **Question 8**

**Which address type is not supported in IPv6?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** `Broadcast`

üîç **Explanation:**
IPv6 does **not use broadcast addresses**. Instead, it uses **multicast** to communicate with multiple hosts.

* **Unicast:** Supported
* **Multicast:** Supported
* **Private (Unique local):** Supported
* **Broadcast:** ‚ùå Not supported in IPv6

---

### **Question 9**

**What is indicated by a successful ping to the ::1 IPv6 address?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** `IP is properly installed on the host.`

üîç **Explanation:**
`::1` is the **loopback address** in IPv6. A successful ping means the **IPv6 stack is functioning properly** on the local machine.
It **does not** test cable, gateway, or link-local connectivity.

---

### **Question 10**

**What is the most compressed representation of the IPv6 address `2001:0db8:0000:abcd:0000:0000:0000:0001`?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** `2001:db8:0:abcd::1`

üîç **Explanation:**
Rules for compression:

* Leading 0s in any block can be removed.
* One sequence of consecutive 0 blocks can be replaced with `::` (only once).

Original:
`2001:0db8:0000:abcd:0000:0000:0000:0001` ‚Üí
Remove leading 0s: `2001:db8:0:abcd:0:0:0:1` ‚Üí
Compress longest 0s: `2001:db8:0:abcd::1`

---

### **Question 11**

**What is the minimum configuration for a router interface that is enabled for IPv6?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** `To have a link-local IPv6 address`

üîç **Explanation:**
IPv6-enabled interfaces **automatically generate a link-local address**, which is **required** and sufficient for basic communication like neighbor discovery.
Global addresses are not mandatory unless external communication is needed.

---

### **Question 12**

**At a minimum, which address is required on IPv6-enabled interfaces?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** `Link-local`

üîç **Explanation:**
Link-local addresses (starting with `FE80::/10`) are **mandatory** for all IPv6 interfaces. They're used for **local communication** like routing protocols, discovery, etc.
Other types (unique local, global) are optional.

---

### **Question 13**

**What are three parts of an IPv6 global unicast address? (Choose three.)**

‚úÖ **Correct Answers:**

* `A global routing prefix that is used to identify the network portion of the address that has been provided by an ISP`
* `A subnet ID that is used to identify networks inside of the local enterprise site`
* `An interface ID that is used to identify the local host on the network`

üîç **Explanation:**
A global unicast address has the following structure:
`[Global Routing Prefix (assigned by ISP)] + [Subnet ID] + [Interface ID]`
Used for uniquely identifying hosts on the internet.

---

### **Question 14**

**Your organization is issued the IPv6 prefix of `2001:db8:130f::/48` by your service provider. With this prefix, how many bits are available for your organization to create /64 subnetworks if interface ID bits are not borrowed?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** `16`

üîç **Explanation:**

* IPv6 address: 128 bits
* /48 prefix ‚Üí 48 bits fixed by ISP
* /64 subnets ‚Üí 64 bits required
* So, **64 ‚àí 48 = 16 bits** available for subnetting
  Your organization can create **2^16 = 65,536** /64 subnets.

---

### **Question 15**

**Which type of IPv6 address is not routable and used only for communication on a single subnet?**

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** `Link-local address`

üîç **Explanation:**

* **Link-local addresses** (`FE80::/10`) are used **only for communication on the local link** (single subnet), such as neighbor discovery and routing.
* They are **not routable** beyond the link.
* Other addresses (global, unique local) **can be routed** within limits.
