| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | What is the recommended prefix length for most IPv6 subnets?                        | A. /32<br>B. /48<br>C. /64<br>D. /128                                                            | âœ… C. /64                   | A /64 prefix is the **standard** for most IPv6 subnets. It allows 64 bits for the network prefix and 64 bits for the interface ID, enabling automatic address configuration (SLAAC).                                               |
| 2    | Which part of a GUA is assigned by the ISP?                                         | A. Global routing prefix<br>B. Global routing prefix and subnet ID<br>C. Prefix<br>D. RIR prefix | âœ… A. Global routing prefix | The **ISP assigns the global routing prefix** (typically the first 48 bits). The organization can then create subnets using the remaining bits.                                                                                    |
| 3    | Which type of IPv6 unicast address is not routable between networks?                | A. Unique local address<br>B. GUA<br>C. Embedded IPv4 address<br>D. LLA                          | âœ… D. LLA                   | **Link-Local Addresses (LLA)** are not routable beyond the local link and are used only for communication within the same local network segment.                                                                                   |
| 4    | True or false? The Subnet ID field in a GUA must borrow bits from the interface ID. | A. True<br>B. False                                                                              | âœ… B. False                 | The **Subnet ID field is separate** from the interface ID in a GUA. Typically, the first 64 bits include the global routing prefix and subnet ID, and the last 64 bits are for the interface ID. No borrowing occurs between them. |
| 5    | What type of IPv6 address begins with `fe80`?                                       | A. GUA<br>B. LLA<br>C. Multicast address<br>D. None. An IPv6 address must begin with 2001.       | âœ… B. LLA                   | IPv6 **Link-Local Addresses (LLA)** always start with the prefix `FE80::/10`. They are required for communication within the same link (e.g., neighbor discovery).                                                                 |
