## âœ… 2.2.1 Primary Command Modes â€“ Explained with Daily Life Examples

Cisco devices have two main modes in CLI (Command Line Interface):

| Command Mode         | Prompt Symbol | Description                                                                                  | Daily Life Example                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User EXEC Mode**   | `>`            | - Basic mode<br>- Only allows view or monitoring commands<br>- No configuration allowed     | Like entering a bank to check your account balance â€“ you can see info but not change it. |
| **Privileged EXEC Mode** | `#`      | - Full access to all commands<br>- Allows configuration and management commands             | Like being the bank manager â€“ you can change account settings, not just view them. |

### ðŸ§  Summary:
- `Switch>` or `Router>` means **User EXEC Mode** (view-only).
- `Switch#` or `Router#` means **Privileged EXEC Mode** (full control).

You must switch to **Privileged EXEC Mode** to configure devices.
