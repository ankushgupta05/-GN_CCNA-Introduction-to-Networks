# 📘 Module 2: Basic Switch and End Device Configuration

## 🎯 Why Should I Take This Module?

Imagine you're setting up a new smart home. Even if all the devices (bulbs, fans, speakers) are brand new, they won't work together until you connect and configure them properly. Similarly, in a network, devices like switches and computers need to be **configured** before they can communicate securely and effectively.

This module helps you:
- Access network devices (like logging into your Wi-Fi router)
- Configure them with unique settings (like naming your Wi-Fi or setting a password)
- Ensure they work together properly (like testing if your phone can stream music from your home server)

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This module is the **foundation** of network setup. Just like you can’t use your gadgets until they’re connected and configured, you can’t build a reliable network until each switch and device is properly set up.

Start here. Configure your devices. Make them talk.
