## üó∫Ô∏è 11.9.1 IPv4 Network Address Planning

### ‚úÖ **What to consider before subnetting:**

* **Total number of subnets**
* **Host requirements per subnet**
* **Device types in each subnet**
* **Use of private vs. public IP addresses**
* **Growth and scalability**
* **Efficient use of address space (especially in DMZ)**

### üìä **General Planning Steps:**

1. **Conduct a network requirement study**:

   * Review both the **intranet** and **DMZ** areas.
   * Decide how segments will be divided.
2. **Address Conservation**:

   * Critical in the **DMZ** (public IPs are limited).
   * Use **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)** for precision.
3. **Private Address Use in Intranet**:

   * Typically uses **10.0.0.0/8**, **172.16.0.0/12**, or **192.168.0.0/16**.
   * Ample addresses for most needs.
   * Larger enterprises may still move to **IPv6** due to limitations.
4. **Address Assignment Plan Should Include**:

   * Host per subnet estimates.
   * Which devices use **static IPs**.
   * Which devices use **DHCP**.
   * Address management for **performance** and **security**.

## üíª 11.9.2 Device Address Assignment

### üîß **Addressing by Device Type:**

| Device Type                   | Addressing Method                       | Notes                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **End-user clients**          | **DHCP**                                | Dynamic allocation, easy to manage, especially for mobile users. |
| **Servers & peripherals**     | **Static IP**                           | Use a consistent scheme for predictability.                      |
| **Internet-facing servers**   | **Public IP + NAT** (if private inside) | May require VPN for remote access if internal only.              |
| **Intermediary devices**      | **Static IP**                           | Needed for monitoring and security systems.                      |
| **Gateway routers/firewalls** | **Static IP**                           | Often assigned the **lowest or highest** IP in the subnet.       |

### üß≠ **Best Practices for Assignment**:

* Follow a **pattern-based approach** (e.g., reserve certain ranges per device type).
* Helps in **administration**, **troubleshooting**, and **documentation**.
* Avoid **IP conflicts** and makes **filtering easier**.

## üîë Final Tips:

* Good IP planning ensures:

  * **Scalability**
  * **Efficient address use**
  * **Improved network performance and security**
* Using **private IPs** internally and reserving **public IPs** for DMZ helps optimize space.
* Don't forget to **document your IP address plan** clearly!
