Here's a clean and clear breakdown of **Private IPv4 Address Blocks** as defined in **RFC 1918**:

### üîπ **Private Address Blocks (RFC 1918)**

| **Network Address** | **CIDR Prefix** | **Address Range**               | **Total Addresses**  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0`          | `/8`            | `10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255`     | \~16.7 million (2¬≤‚Å¥) |
| `172.16.0.0`        | `/12`           | `172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255`   | \~1 million (2¬≤‚Å∞)    |
| `192.168.0.0`       | `/16`           | `192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255` | \~65,000 (2¬π‚Å∂)       |

### üî∏ Key Points

* These addresses are **not routable** on the public internet.
* They are commonly used for **private LANs**, **home networks**, **enterprise intranets**, etc.
* Devices using private addresses communicate with the public internet through **Network Address Translation (NAT)**.
* Often referred to as the **RFC 1918 address space**.

---

### üîπ Why Use Private IPs?

* Conserves public IP addresses.
* Enhances internal network security (not reachable from outside).
* Essential for internal communication within organizations or homes.

Here's a clear and summarized explanation of **Routing to the Internet using Private IPv4 Addresses and NAT**, based on section **11.3.2**:

---

## üåê 11.3.2 Routing to the Internet

### üîπ Internal Network and Private IPs

* Most **intranets** (home or enterprise) use **private IPv4 addresses**.
* Private IPs **cannot be routed** on the public internet.
* Example private networks:

  * `10.0.0.0/8`
  * `172.16.0.0/16`
  * `192.168.0.0/24`

---

### üî∏ The Problem

* Devices inside private networks generate packets with:

  * **Private source IP address**
  * **Public destination IP address**
* Since private IPs are **non-routable**, **ISPs must not forward** them to the internet.

---

### üîπ The Solution: NAT (Network Address Translation)

* **NAT translates** a **private IP** to a **public IP** before forwarding packets to the internet.
* This translation occurs on the **router** that connects the internal network to the **ISP**.

#### ‚úÖ Benefits of NAT:

* Allows **multiple private devices** to access the internet using **one or few public IPs**.
* Conserves the **limited pool of IPv4 addresses**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:

> NAT is **not** a security mechanism. The IETF does **not** consider private IPs or NAT as **effective security measures**.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

* A **DMZ** is a portion of the network that contains **publicly accessible servers** (e.g., web or mail servers).
* These servers are assigned **public IPv4 addresses**.
* The router:

  * **Routes traffic** between intranet, DMZ, and internet
  * Performs **NAT**
  * Acts as a **firewall**

---

### üîÅ Example Workflow:

1. Host in Network 1 (IP: `192.168.0.10`) wants to access a website.
2. Packet has source IP `192.168.0.10` (private) and destination IP `142.250.183.206` (e.g., google.com).
3. The router:

   * Translates source IP to a public IP (e.g., `203.0.113.1`)
   * Forwards the packet to the ISP
4. The return packet goes to `203.0.113.1`, and the router translates it back to `192.168.0.10`.

### üß† Summary Table

| **Component**        | **Role**                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private IP Addresses | Used within internal networks (not routable on internet)      |
| NAT                  | Converts private IPs to public IPs for internet communication |
| Router               | Routes, performs NAT, and may act as firewall                 |
| DMZ                  | Hosts public-facing servers with public IPs                   |
| ISP                  | Provides internet access and expects public IP traffic only   |
