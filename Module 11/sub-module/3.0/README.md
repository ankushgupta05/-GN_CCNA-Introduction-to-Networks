Here's a clean and clear breakdown of **Private IPv4 Address Blocks** as defined in **RFC 1918**:

### 🔹 **Private Address Blocks (RFC 1918)**

| **Network Address** | **CIDR Prefix** | **Address Range**               | **Total Addresses**  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0`          | `/8`            | `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`     | \~16.7 million (2²⁴) |
| `172.16.0.0`        | `/12`           | `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`   | \~1 million (2²⁰)    |
| `192.168.0.0`       | `/16`           | `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` | \~65,000 (2¹⁶)       |

### 🔸 Key Points

* These addresses are **not routable** on the public internet.
* They are commonly used for **private LANs**, **home networks**, **enterprise intranets**, etc.
* Devices using private addresses communicate with the public internet through **Network Address Translation (NAT)**.
* Often referred to as the **RFC 1918 address space**.

### 🔹 Why Use Private IPs?

* Conserves public IP addresses.
* Enhances internal network security (not reachable from outside).
* Essential for internal communication within organizations or homes.
