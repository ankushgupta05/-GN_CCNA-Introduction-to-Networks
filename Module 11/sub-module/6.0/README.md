Here's a summarized and clear explanation of **Subnetting on and within Octet Boundaries** from sections **11.5.1 and 11.5.2** of your material:

---

## ðŸ”¹ **11.5.1 Subnet on an Octet Boundary**

### âœ… What is Subnetting?

* **Subnetting** divides a large network into smaller, manageable pieces called **subnets**.
* It **borrows bits** from the host portion of the IP address and **extends the subnet mask**.
* The more bits borrowed:

  * âž• More subnets.
  * âž– Fewer hosts per subnet.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Subnet on Octet Boundaries?

Subnetting is easier at the natural **octet boundaries**:

* `/8` (e.g., 255.0.0.0)
* `/16` (e.g., 255.255.0.0)
* `/24` (e.g., 255.255.255.0)

### ðŸ“Š Example: Subnetting 10.0.0.0/8

| Subnet Mask | Subnets Available | Hosts per Subnet | Notes                       |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| /8          | 1                 | 16,777,214       | Too large for most networks |
| /16         | 256               | 65,534           | Still large but better      |
| /24         | 65,536            | 254              | Very popular and manageable |

---

## ðŸ”¹ **11.5.2 Subnet Within an Octet Boundary**

When more control is needed, **bits can be borrowed within an octet**, not just on boundaries.

### ðŸ§  Example: Subnetting a /24 network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

| New Prefix | Bits Borrowed | Subnets Created | Hosts/Subnet |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| /25        | 1             | 2               | 126          |
| /26        | 2             | 4               | 62           |
| /27        | 3             | 8               | 30           |
| /28        | 4             | 16              | 14           |
| /29        | 5             | 32              | 6            |
| /30        | 6             | 64              | 2            |

ðŸ”Ž Note: **Fewer hosts per subnet**, but **more subnets**. Useful for **point-to-point links**, **small departments**, or **tight security zones**.

## âœ… Key Takeaways

* **Subnetting reduces broadcast domains**, improving performance and scalability.
* **Octet-boundary subnetting** (e.g., /24) is simple and common.
* **Intra-octet subnetting** (e.g., /27) gives fine-grained control, useful in more complex designs.

To **create 1000 subnets** from a **10.0.0.0/8** network, we follow this step-by-step process:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Given:**

* **Original Network**: `10.0.0.0/8` â†’ default Class A
* **Available host bits**: 32 (total bits) âˆ’ 8 (network bits) = **24 host bits**
* **Required Subnets**: 1000

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Determine Number of Bits to Borrow**

To find how many bits we need to borrow from the host portion:

We need at least **1000 subnets**, so:

$$
2^n \geq 1000
$$

Solving:

* $2^9 = 512$ â†’ too few
* $2^{10} = 1024$ âœ…

âœ… **Borrow 10 bits** â†’ **creates 1024 subnets**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: New Subnet Mask**

Original mask:

* `/8` = `255.0.0.0`

After borrowing 10 bits:

* New mask = `/8 + 10 = /18`
* `/18` in dotted decimal = `255.255.192.0`

So, **each subnet will have:**

* **Network**: `/18`
* **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.192.0`

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Hosts per Subnet**

Remaining host bits:

* $32 - 18 = 14$ bits

Maximum number of hosts per subnet:

$$
2^{14} - 2 = 16,384 - 2 = 16,382 \text{ usable hosts}
$$

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 4: Subnet Address Increments**

* Increment between subnets (based on the last borrowed bit):

  * Subnet block size = $2^{14} = 16,384$ IPs
  * 16,384 IPs = `64` addresses in the 3rd octet (`2^6 = 64`)
  * So, the subnet increases every `64` in the third octet

| 1024          | `10.255.192.0/18` | `10.255.192.1` | `10.255.255.254` | `10.255.255.255`  |
