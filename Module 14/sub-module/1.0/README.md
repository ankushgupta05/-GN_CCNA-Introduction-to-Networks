Here are the correct answers for the **14.1.7 Check Your Understanding - Transportation of Data**:

---

### **Question 1**

**Which layer is responsible for establishing a temporary communication session between the source and destination host applications?**

✅ **Transport layer**

> The transport layer (Layer 4) is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions between applications on source and destination hosts.

---

### **Question 2**

**Which three are transport layer responsibilities? (Choose three.)**

✅ **Conversation multiplexing**
❌ Identifying frames
❌ Identifying routing information
✅ **Segmenting data and reassembling segments**
✅ **Tracking individual conversations**

> The transport layer handles:

* **Multiplexing**: Allows multiple applications to use the network at once.
* **Segmentation and reassembly**: Breaks data into segments for transmission and reassembles it at the destination.
* **Tracking conversations**: Keeps track of different sessions or connections.

✅ **UDP is a best-effort delivery protocol.**

> UDP (User Datagram Protocol) provides **best-effort delivery** without guaranteed reliability, ordering, or data integrity.

---

### **Question 4**

**Which transport layer protocol would be used for VoIP applications?**

✅ **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**

> VoIP uses **UDP** because it offers low-latency communication. While it doesn't guarantee delivery, it's faster and better suited for real-time applications like voice and video.
