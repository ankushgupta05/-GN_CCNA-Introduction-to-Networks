Here’s a simplified explanation of **Frame Forwarding Methods on Cisco Switches**:

---

### 🚀 **1. Store-and-Forward Switching**

* **How it works**: The switch **waits** to receive the **entire frame**, checks it for errors using **CRC**, then forwards it.
* **Advantage**: Prevents **bad data** from spreading in the network.
* **Used for**: High-quality needs like **VoIP**, where error-free delivery and **priority (QoS)** matter.

---

### ⚡ **2. Cut-Through Switching**

* **How it works**: The switch reads the **first 6 bytes** to get the **destination MAC**, then **forwards** the frame immediately—**before the entire frame is received**.
* **Advantage**: **Faster** than store-and-forward but **no error checking**.

#### Types of Cut-Through Switching:

| Type              | Description                                             | Latency | Error Handling      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| **Fast-Forward**  | Forwards right after reading destination                | Lowest  | No error checking   |
| **Fragment-Free** | Waits for first **64 bytes** (where most errors happen) | Low     | Partial error check |

---

### ⛓️ **Dynamic Switching**

* Some switches **auto-switch** between cut-through and store-and-forward:

  * If too many errors → switch to **store-and-forward**
  * When errors drop → go back to **cut-through**

### 🧠 **7.4.3 Memory Buffering on Switches**

When a switch receives frames faster than it can forward them (due to port congestion), it uses **memory buffering** to store those frames temporarily.

#### Types of Memory Buffering:

| Method            | Description                                                                 | Pros                                                                             | Cons                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Port-based**    | Each port has its own buffer (queue). Frames wait their turn per port.      | Simple design                                                                    | A busy port can block others from sending |
| **Shared memory** | All ports use a **common buffer**. Frames dynamically use memory as needed. | Efficient, supports **asymmetric switching** (e.g., 10Gbps ↔ 1Gbps), fewer drops | More complex                              |

### 🔁 **7.4.4 Duplex and Speed Settings**

* **Full-duplex**: Devices **send & receive at the same time** → better performance
* **Half-duplex**: Devices **send OR receive**, not both → chance of **collisions**

#### 🚦Autonegotiation:

* Devices automatically pick the **best common speed and duplex**.
* Works best when **both devices have autonegotiation ON**.
* **Gigabit Ethernet** only works in **full-duplex** mode.

> ⚠️ **Duplex mismatch** causes collisions and poor performance. Example: one device in full-duplex, other in half-duplex.

---

### 🔌 **7.4.5 Auto-MDIX (Automatic Crossover Detection)**

* Used to **automatically detect cable type** (straight-through vs crossover).
* You can **plug in any Ethernet cable**, and the switch will adjust.
* **Enabled by default** in Cisco IOS 12.2(18)SE+ but can be turned off.
* Still a **good habit** to use the correct cable type.
